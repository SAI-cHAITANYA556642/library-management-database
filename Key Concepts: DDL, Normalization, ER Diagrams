##DDL [Data Definition Language]
Part of SQL used to define and manage database structure.  
Includes commands like:  
CREATE → make new tables or databases  
ALTER → modify existing tables  
DROP → delete tables or databases  

##Normalization  
This is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.  
It breaks large tables into smaller, related tables.  

Common Normal Forms:  
1NF: No repeating groups, atomic values only.  
2NF: 1NF + no partial dependency on primary key.  
3NF: 2NF + no transitive dependency (non-key attributes depend only on PK).  
Example:  
Instead of storing the author name in every book row, create an Author table and link it with a Foreign Key.  

##ER Diagram[Entity Relationship Diagram] 
A visual representation of entities (tables) and the relationships between them.  
Shapes & Symbols:  
Rectangle: Entity/Table  
Diamond: Relationship  
Line: Connection between entities  

Example in LibraryDB:  
Category → (1:N) → Book  
Book ↔ (M:N) ↔ Author (via Book_Author)  
Member → (1:N) → Loan
